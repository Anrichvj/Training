      <h3>The Hyundai i30N</h3>
      <p> The Hyundai i30 N is like the Korean fried chicken of hot hatches, bringing a twist from an unexpected source
        on the
        classic recipe.

        You’ll immediately spot this is no regular Hyundai i30. The N gets an aggressive new body kit, lots of red
        striping,
        lightweight 19-inch alloy wheels and a massive twin-exit exhaust system to highlight its boy racer aspirations.

        Changes to the inside aren’t quite so obvious at first glance. The N does get some sports seats, a new steering
        wheel and blue stitching, but the core design of the i30 remains the same. That is until you switch it on to be
        greeted by shift lights, an N logo in the instrument cluster and a serious growl from the exhaust.</p>
